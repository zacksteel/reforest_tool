# Climate-wise Reforestation Toolkit  

<br>

Welcome to the climate-wise reforestation toolkit. This site includes three resources intended to inform post-disturbance reforestation practices in the Sierra Nevada mountains: 1) a spatial reforestation prioritization tool, 2) a post-drought stand condition summary tool, and 3) reforestation best management practices (BMPs). The purpose and methodology of each resource are briefly summarized here. More detailed information can be found in the Technical Information tab and in a video tutorial of the toolkit. Additionally, users are encouraged to consult literature reviewing the state of the science of forest reforestation strategies, especially North et al. 2019 and associated reserach brief.   

<br>

1) Prioritization tool: This tool combines remotely-sensed estimates of forest mortality with user-weighted data layers to prioritize areas for reforestation within a given area of interest in the Sierra Nevada mountians.  

2) Stand condition summary tool: This tool summarizes stand data collected following the recent 2012-16 drought in # areas of the Sierra Nevada.  

3) BMPs: Reforestation Best Management Practices are summarized based on a recent review of the state of the science. Emphasis is placed on strategies that consider climate change and altered disturbance regimes rather than the technical aspects of reforestation, which can be found elsewhere.
