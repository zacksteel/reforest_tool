## Overview  

This document provides additional technical information associated with the prioritization and stand summary tools. Content within the Climate-wise Reforestation Toolkit was developed by Zack Steel, Marc Myer, Amarina Wuenschel, Steve Ostoja, and Malcolm North with funding provided by the US Forest Service.  

## Data processing & sources  

Forest biomass loss  
* Calculated as the percentage change from 2012 to 2016 estimates  
* Original data from the [LEMMA lab at Oregon State University]("https://lemma.forestry.oregonstate.edu/") and the USDA Forest Service Region 5.  

Climate Water Deficit (CWD)  
* 1981-2010 average potential minus actual evapotranspiration -
* Data layer developed as part of the California Basin Characterization Model and acquired from [California Climate Commons]("http://climate.calcommons.org/variable/climatic-water-deficit")  

High-severity Fire Core  
* Defined as areas within high-severity patches that are a minimum of 200m away from a lower severity edge (i.e. areas far from living tree seed sources).  
* Data source: [USDA Forest Service Geospatial Data]("https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r5/landmanagement/gis/?cid=STELPRDB5327833")  

Wildland urban Interface (WUI)  
* Data source: Cal Fire [Fire and Resource Assessment Program]("https://frap.fire.ca.gov/mapping/gis-data/")  

Recreation Areas  
* Data Source: [USDA Forest Service Geospatial Data]("https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r5/landmanagement/gis/?cid=STELPRDB5327833")   

Spotted Owl Protected Activity Centers (PACs)  
* Data Source: [Data Basin]("https://databasin.org/datasets/ee608449-2619-4c72-816c-0a75b1801015")  

Fisher Core Habitat areas  
* Data Source: [Data Basin]("https://databasin.org/datasets/ba0ca69e7e024cfdbf816a33b64238a5")
